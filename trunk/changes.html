</ul>
<b>Changes from 1.6.21 to 1.6.22:</b>
<ul>
    <li>
      Adapted the example "game1" to ball.inc so that it compiles and runs.
</ul>
<b>Changes from 1.6.20 to 1.6.21:</b>
<ul>
    <li>
      Changed from `file_size' to `file_size_ex' to make it compatible with
      Allegro 4.2.1 (int obtext.c, loadtext.c, files.c and datedit.c).
    <li>
      New feature: make it possible to optionally pass 3 different label icons
      for the states normal, inactive and focus/over. object.h, object.c
      obbutton.c and menbarcm.c.
    <li>
      Added docs for the state icons feature.
    <li>
      Fixed bug (+feature): When clicking fast in list-boxes more than one row
      sometimes get marked although the shift key is not down. This can happen
      even if "multiple rows selection" is turned off. This problem is
      solved (msm.c) by letting widgets get focus immediately when they go to
      the "in"-state (before they got the focus not until a successful click).
      This new behaviour (slightly different from before) is likely to be
      desired.
    <li>
      Fixed bug: When creating new datafile objects these are initialized
      with the properties "XPOS;YPOS;XSIZ;YSIZ". These have no special meaning
      when used in cgui: filedat.c and datimage.c.
    <li>
      Fixed warnings due to a more strict type analysis in newer versions of
      gcc: dos2win.c, graphini.c, loadtext.c, obedbox.c, win2dos.c.
    <li>
      Fixed bug: All examples that use hot keys use them the wrong
      way, making them not respond to the hot keys (examples 09, 13, 15, 17
      and 21).
    <li>
      Fixed bug: The handling of hot keys contains a lot of strange code that
      e.g. makes it impossible to assign a separat hot key using the ALT+key
      combination. Any altering of keypresses except for changing to uniform
      case (which is legal according the docs, and which should be kept as is)
      are removed. Application programmers should use the Allegro encoding
      only for scan/ascii. hotkey.c and object.c
    <li>
      Modified the docs according to the above (SetHotKey()).
    <li>
      Modified the docs about using images in labels in general (far more
      object types were supported than listed).
    <li>
      Added new feature: A function to iterate an application function using
      the event queue, making it easier to use that technique.
    <li>
      Added docs for the above
    <li>
      Modified the examples to benefit the above feature.
</ul>
<b>Changes from 1.6.19 to 1.6.20:</b>
<ul>
    <li>

      Made the DELETE key work in editboxes and as Hot-key.
    <li>
      Made text on inactive objects more readable.
    <li>
      Fixed bug that made back-tab not works in active edit-box.
    <li>
      Exported existing function `CreateNewDataFile'.
    <li>
      Fixed a minor bug in example 21canvas.
    <li>
      Moved the initialization of text strings from creation to SetSize to make the box more dynamic.
    <li>
      Fixed warnings "use of cast expressions as lvalues is deprecated" in list.c, from gcc 3.4
    <li>

<b>Changes from 1.6.3 to 1.6.4:</b>
<ul>
<li>
   More bugs concerning mouse: If a Requser was started before ProcessEvents were called the
   mouse got lost (freezed)
<li>
   Correction of the error handling in the date format functions.
<li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Changes from 1.6.2 to 1.6.3:</b>
<ul>
<li>
   Bug (introduced in 1.6.2): The mouse is blocked if calling Req(),
   FileSelect() Invite() or ProcessEvents() from a mouse call-back after the
   initial ProcessEvents().
</ul>

<p>
<b>Changes from 1.6.1 to 1.6.2:</b>
<ul>
<li>
   Added Frensh translation of dialog texts.
<li>
   Changed mouse event processing to totally polled in order to hope that
   solves the problem with random lost (or "freezed") mouse cursor.
<li>
   Changed o to $(OBJ_SUFFIX) in MKTEXT_OBJS in makefile.all
<li>
   Exported parse in tools/t_parser.h (file was empty)
<li>
   The border of the progress bar showed garbage colors. Changed
   #define FRAMEW HEADERFRAME #define FRAMEW 1 in file obprogr.c
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
   Fixed a potential bug in mouse state machine.
<li>
   Fixed bug that made example 25 crash
<li>
   Added a missed line about an API change in previous version, see below

<li>
   Fixed bug in example 25
<li>
   Corrected contributors name (Oscar Giner)

</ul>

<p>
<b>Changes from 1.5.1 to 1.6:</b>
<ul>
<li>
   API change: 'LoadImage' is changed to 'CguiLoadImage' to avoid conflict
   with some Windows header.
<li>
   Oscar Giner added translations for Spanish langugage
<li>
   Ferenc Havr�nek added translations for Hungarian langugage
<li>
   More space added around the desription text of buttons.
<li>
   Initialisation: Alternative functions to explictly initilise CGUI
   with screenmode options (like loading settings from file, using current
   settings, windowed mode etc.) has been added. This replaces the cryptical
   0,0,0 codes to InitCgui. The latter can still used for fully
   API compatibility with vesrion 1.5.
<li>
   Rafal Szyja created an alternative set of icons for the icons in built-in dialogues
<li>
   Using sound card when present (instead of the PC-speaker beep)

 <li> Rafal Szyja finished translation of Polish texts.
 <li> The current data file listing was not updated after "Use palette", in the file browser.
 <li> Docs: wrong home-page address.
 <li> Docs: Added link to logo.
 <li> Docs: Forgot to run the fixver script (version was marked as "beta").
</ul>

<p>
<b>Changes from 1.4 to 1.5:</b>
<ul>
  <li> New feature: Build procedures for Linux, and MSVC has been added, as
       well as dynamic and debug alternatives for the ports.
  <li> New feature: Several steps have been taken to simplify the make
       procedure of CGUI.
  <ul>
    <li> The path to Allegro is no longer necessary since the makedoc
         utility is included in the distro of CGUI 1.5
    <LI> The text file containing the label-texts and the headers refering
         to that, is now included in the distribution as source files, so
         the mktext utility does not need to be built when building libcgui.
         (This shouldn't make any difference for normal users, but the
         distro will thereby be more fault tolerant. For developers of
         the CGUI lib these files needs to be built).
    <li> Applications using CGUI 1.4 needed to link with libaldat.a which is not
         installed by the Allegro 'make install'. That needed to be handled
         separately. In CGUI 1.5 datlib is a part of the CGUI lib itself.
    <li> Applications using CGUI 1.4 needed to link with datedit.o in
         allegro/tools. This file is a part of the lib itself in CGUI version 1.5.
    <li> Applications using CGUI 1.4 needed to have the file cgui.dat present
         in the directory of the executable. This file is a part of
         lib itself in version 1.5.
  </ul>
  <LI> "Tool-tip" texts, has been added. See the docs for details.
  <LI> Rafal Szyja made the CGUI logo.
  <LI> Rafal Szyja added Polish translation of the the built in dialog texts.
  <li> The text in a textbox can now be updated using `UpdateTextBoxText'.
  <LI> Improved dialogue for screen mode selection. A
       button "Apply" has been added and the mode will not change until that
       one has been pressed. Also a possibility to select graphics driver
       has been added.
  <LI> When an object is sensible for both clicks and
       drag-and-drop (using the same mouse button), the mouse-handler
       distinguished the two states using a delay.
       Now the mouse movement is used instead of the delay, which is a
       better solution.
  <li> `Home' and `End' keys has been added for browsing in lists.
  <li> Files imorted to a dat-file will be stored using its
       relative path rather that absolute.
  <li> Bug in the filebrowser: Importing a wav-file didn't work (or rather:
       importing an object which have an extension that can be imported to a
       unique data file type has this problem)
  <li> Bug in the filebrowser: Importing a wav-file gave memeory error.
  <li> Bug in the browsing object: when a list-box is created with explicit
       coordinates, the handle of the browsing object will be only 3 pixels
       high.
  <li> Bug in DeInitCgui. It didn't really complete the de-initialization
       until the program exited. This could look like the keyboard was
       locked, since CGUI's keyboard handler was still there stealing all
       presses, and doing nothing with them.
  <li> Bug in the event system. The bug showed up sometimes when a program
       was about to terminate. More precise, if there were delayed events
       and the program terminated by a call to 'StopProcessEvents' the
       program hang in an infinite loop, just before final exit.
  <li> Bug in edit-box object fixed.
  <li> Bug that occasionally crashed the program (stack overflow due to
       infinite recursion, may even crash the system) when trying to
       refresh an empty list.
  <li> Bug in the canvas object. The games* examples crashed often when
       exit, and also the 21canvas examples (and if a window containing a
       canvas was moved, there would occure undefined contents of the
       canvas' bitmap).
  <li> The example 10lists was not correctly built.
  <li> The example 20anim didn't show correct colours if running in 8bpp.
  <li> The re-try sequence when InitCgui fails to set the graphics mode has
       been changed. Now not always assuming that a less bpp is more hopeful.
       If 15 bpp mode does not work it tries 16 bpp and if 24 fails it
       tries 32.
  <LI> When a new object was created under the mouse cursor, then the mouse
       had to be moved (or clicked) to notify the objet that there was a a
       mouse over it. In some cases this might have looked like "dropped
       events").

<b>Changes from 1.3.1 to 1.4</b>
<P>Changes in the API:
<BR><B><TT>SetFocusOn(int id);</TT></B> has been added. It replaces `<B><TT>FocusOn</TT></B>',
   `<B><TT>SetVisibleWindow</TT></B>', `<B><TT>SetSubFocus</TT></B>' and `<B><TT>SetTabFocus</TT></B>'
   which all had the same semantic (to set focus on the specified object).
   The replaced functions are still present for compatibility.
<BR><B><TT>JoinTabChain(int id);</TT></B> has been added. It replaces `<B><TT>SimpleJoinTabChain</TT></B>'
   and `<B><TT>NodeJoinTabChain</TT></B>'.The replaced functions are still
   present for compatibility.
<BR><B><TT>AddTextBox(int x, int y, const char *string, int width, int
   nrows, int options);</TT></B> replaces `<B><TT>MkTextObject'</TT></B> (which
   still exists for compatibility). The 5:th patameter has changed meaning.
   For `<B><TT>MkTextObject</TT></B>' it meant "extra space between rows",
   For `<B><TT>AddTextBox</TT></B>' it means the height of the box. There
   are more option flags, and also the facilities of the box has been increased.
<BR>`<B><TT>FileSelect()</TT></B>' has been added as well as `<B><TT>FileManager()</TT></B>',
   see docs for details.
<BR>`<B><TT>AddWatch()</TT></B>' has been added, see docs for details.
<BR>`<B><TT>AddSlider()</TT></B>' has been added, see docs for details.
<BR>`<B><TT>AddProgressBar()</TT></B>' has been added as well as `<B><TT>MkProgressWindow()</TT></B>',
   see docs for details.
<BR>`<B><TT>GetMarkedRows()</TT></B>' has been added. It replaces `<B><TT>GetQueuedSelections()</TT></B>',
   See docs for details. The replaced function is still present for compatibility.
<UL>
<p>
  <li> A number of features has been added (see the listing above, see the docs and see also the examples).
  <LI> The text-generating function has got improved error handling:
     <ul>
     <li> A new parameter of&amp;nbsp; `<B><TT>LoadText</TT></B>' has been added.
          It is a pointer to int. The memory location pointed to will be set to 0
          if the named section was not found in which case the return value of `<B><TT>LoadTexts</TT></B>'
          will be <B><TT>NULL</TT></B> and a warning message will be displayed for
          the user. If the section was found the value will be set to the number
          of texts that was contained in the section (which may of course also be
          0 for meaningless empty sections).
     <li> The text-compiling program `<B><TT>mktext</TT></B>' generates an
          additional macro (the identifier is the section name prefixed with <TT>`<B>SIZE_</B>'</TT>)
          that is defined to the number of texts in that section of the source.
          This macro can be used to check if the number of texts found by
          `LoadTexts' (see above) is correct.
     <li> (bugfix) The text-strings (concerning the `mktext' tool) may
          now also contain the leading language and section markers (i.e. `&lt;;' and `[')
     <li> (potential error) `<B><TT>mktext</TT></B>' changed to use cgui's
          memory allocation functions (the allocations were not asserted).
     </ul>
  <LI> (bugfix) The `<B><TT>FocusOn</TT></B>' function for `<B><TT>EditBoxes</TT></B>'
     forgot to move the focus from the object currently beeing in focus (the
     edit-box example got crazy and generated an infinte number of windows)</LI>
  <LI> The list in Drop-Down-boxes may now contain images.</LI>
  <LI> A bug in "KillEvent" has been fixed. May have been harmful in edit-boxes
       (related to cursor-blinking - a dircet selection from focused edit-box
       to other object may possibly have generated memory error).</LI>
  <LI> The "focusing"-system has been partially re-written, including setting
       windows in focus.</LI>
  <LI> Indication of focused push-buttons extended to make it possible to see that
       an iconed object is in focus.</LI>
  <LI> The "text-box" has been extended with a number of useful facilities, se
       the docs for details.</LI>
  <LI> Fixed bug: calling InitCgui a second time crashed if there were icons
       in use.</LI>
</UL>

<p><br>
<b>Changes from 1.3 to 1.3.1</b>
<UL>
<p>
  <LI> Fixed docs: In version 1.3 the docs are broken (makeinfo fails, only
       html-docs is available)
  <LI> The docs is corrected (const-parameters and return values was documented
       without the const-qualifier).
  <LI> Two more functions has been "constified".
</UL>
<hr>
<p><br>
<b>Changes from 1.2 to 1.3</b>
New features:
<UL>
<p>
  <LI> The spinbuttons now adapt thier height to be half the default height
       of other objects.
  <LI> A function for "clipping" to avoid redundant areas to be blitted when
       using canvas-objects for animations. The function SetBlitLimit has
       now been added. Calling it before the canvas blits to screen will
       use the specified limits, after the blit the limits will be reset.
       The "game*" examples shows the usage.
  <LI> Adding a parameter to Req() that specifies a window header.
  <LI> A global variable to make it possible to turn off the usage of
       vsync() in cgui. The name is `cgui_use_vsync'. It is initally set
       to true.
  <LI> All objects (not only edit-boxes) is now automatically "tabbed", in
       version 1.2 they must be "tabbed" explicitly by a call to
       SimpleJoinTabChain(). Customizing the tab-order by use of
       SimpleJoinTabChain() is still possible.
  <LI> When "tabbing" to an editbox it is no longer necessary to press
       enter-key to focus it (i.e. make the cursor blinking and beeing
       ready for input). In version 1.2 the tabbing just marked the box as
       selected.
  <LI> A flag `cgui_mouse_draw_in_interrupt' is introduced. Initially it is
       set to 0. If you set it the mouse will be drawn in the callback
       (interrupt). By default the drawing is done as in version 1.2, i.e.
       the callback puts a message into the event queue, which when
       processed will draw the cursor. The purpose with setting
       cgui_mouse_draw_in_interrupt is to have a more alert cursor. Testing
       the examples on a slow machine (P133) don't show any need for it.
      <BR>Drawing the mouse-cursor in the interrupt doesn't work well
          together with canvases for the moment.
  <LI> The function InitFont is removed as well as the clobal variabel
       CGUI_font.In their place there are the two functions void
       SetCguiFont(FONT *f) and FONT *GetCguiFont(void). (It was quite
       stupid with a global variable, which required a function call after
       change).
  <LI> InitCgui no longer changes the palette if the graphics is already
       initialized. If the palette needs to be changed Allegros functions
       must be used. A new function named SetCguiColors(int exact) can be
       used to let cgui search in the current palette and select the colours
       that is as close as possible to cgui's needings. If `exact' is
       non-zero the colours of the pallette entries that was selected will
       be adjusted to be exact those needed for cgui. If `exact' is 0 these
       colours may not be affected.
     <BR>If the graphics has not been initialized before InitCgui is called,
         and InitCgui set the colour to 8 bits, then it will set the colours
         for the palette indecies of the cgui colours (`cgui_*') to what it
         need.
  <LI> The makefile can now optionally link using a statically linked
       Allegro lib. See readme.txt of CGUI 1.3 for details.
</UL>
<p>
Bug fixes:
<UL>
<p>
  <LI> Objects sometimes remained in the "pressed view" dispite that the
       mouse-button is up and the cursor is not even over. This "hanging"
       could be reset by a new click. The problem was that there was no
       object-refresh for a state transition directly from
       mouse-button-down-and-over to init (the normal transition is to
       either mouse-button-down-off or mouse-button-up-and-over).
  <LI> Sometimes (randomly) it seemed as events were dropped. Keypresses
       and/or mouse-events sometimes seemd to be missed when running
       applications on a slow P1-box, but the problem couldn't be surely
       repeated on a 400MHz P2 computer. There were two errors: The
       mouse-data buffer (a filtered single-buffer was used) that interfaced
       the interrupt-handler and the state-machine was sometimes overrun.
       The concept has been changed in 1.3 and a 1024 positions buffer has
       been introduced. The second problem was that the event-processor's
       transfering of pending events to the event queue occationally
       interfered with the interrupt-handlers' marking of new pending
       events.
  <LI> The second time the ESC-key was pressed in the example "game1" it
       was not recognized. Reason: Incompleate de-init.
  <LI> The program crashes when moving the mouse over the menu that pops up
       when right-clicking in an edit-box (this is probably a general
       problem with "scratch-menus"). Reason: improper initialization.
  <LI> When a huge number of digits is entered into an integer valued
       edit-box it crashes. This is due to a limitation in gcc (djgpp): all
       numeric strings with a number of digits more than 62 crashes when
       scanning to integer type. The input limit for numbers is now set to
       less than 62 characters (it was 100 before).
</UL>
<hr>
<p><br>
<b>Changes from 1.1 to 1.2</b>
<UL>
<p>
  <LI> Corrected a bug (present also on the DJGPP platform) that crashed the
       program when moving the cursor to the left or bottom edge of the
       screen.
  <LI> Corrected a bug that crashed the program when the cursor goes from
       "ready to re-size" to "outside object". Analogue problem when
       dragging. (No problem under DJGPP)
  <LI> Corrected a bug that crashed the program when DeActivate or Activate
       was called with a node-id as parameter.(No problem under DJGPP).
  <LI> Corrected a bug that crashed the program when calling SetListColumns.
       (No problem under DJGPP).
  <LI> Corrected a bug that crashed the program when using drag-and-drop and
       dragging something over areas illegal to drop on and then returning
       to a "droppable" place. (No problem under DJGPP).
  <LI> Corrected a bug that crashed the program when re-sizing the height of
       a list to less than 0. (No problem under DJGPP).
  <LI> Corrected a bug that crashed the program if the mouse was dragged
       repeatedly over a number of menu-items when another window is in
       focus and on top of the window with the menus. (No problem under
       DJGPP).
  <LI> Corrected an bug that randomly hanged the mouse cursor. (No problem
       under DJGPP).
  <LI> Corrected a bug that made it possible to re-size a simple object to
       be of a height less than 0 (after that it was not possible to stretch
       it again).
  <LI> "constified" a number of parameters to various functions in CGUI.
  <LI> Some changes in the examples (some memory voilations which led to
       crash on the windows platform, and some changes to conform to the
       changes in CGUI).
</UL>
<hr>
<p><br>
<b>Changes from 1.0 to 1.1</b>
<UL>
<p>
  <LI> Adaption made to support allegro 3.9.37: Variables
       _keyboard_installed and _color_depth become undefined since the
       externals in allegro.h moved to alintern.h. Variables was used to
       restore the inital state of Allegro if Allegro was initalized before
       cgui. Solved by skipping the keyboard check and making a dirty look
       in the vtable struct. No changes in functionality.
  <LI> The allegro config-file in the examples directory changed language
       from se to en, and some irrelvant test-stuff has been removed from it.
