Wish List

Below is listed features that would be useful to have in CGUI. Some of these
includes quite a lot of work for a single person, so they will probably
not be done by me. So if you want some of these features, it's better to
write it yourself and send me a patch. Or maybe you just have an idea what
would be yet one useful feature? -Just send a mail!
<ul>
<li>
   Adding skinnability (to some extent)
<LI>
   Support for mouse wheel.
<li>
   Feature request, file browser: The data file objects could inherit the
   viewed permission flags from the ones of the data file itself.
<li>
   Feature request, file selector: The possibility to pass named file name suffixes (or e
   groups of) to be used as fixed alternatives instead of the editable one. A complementary
   function will be needed for that.
<li>
   Feature request, file browser: An option to dock the preview window into the browser.
<li>
   Performance: The mouse is very inresponsive running on some Linux boxes.
<li>
   Feature request: Speed up the mouse by using harware mouse when such is detected.
<li>
   Feature request: It would be great to have the usual window buttons for controling the
   window size etc. at the top.
<LI>
   Remove the DOS-ish beep that sounds when an erroneous key is pressed
   in an edit-box (or add support for Allegro sound )
<LI>
   Creating makefiles for the more of the platforms supported by Allegro, specially MAC.
<li>
   Porting to Unicode.
<li>
   Making an RPM for Linux.
<li>
   A widget for help text viewing (HTML-based).
<li>
   A widget for multi line input.
<li>
   Internally prefixing.
<li>
   Exporting a subset of the now external declared variables and functions in an "include/internal"
   directory similar to Allegro, just to make it easier for people to make som fun things.
<li>
   Externally prefixing (for a future version).
</ul>
