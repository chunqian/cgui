Introduction

CGUI is a Graphical User Interface library. It contains functions that you
can use to create windows with buttons, lists, edit boxes etc. Read the
documentation (you find it in the docs directory of cgui) for details. The
docs will be built in several formats when you build the library (see below)

CGUI compiles on the following platforms: DOS/DJGPP, Linux, Cygwin, Mac OS X
Windows/Mingw32, and Windows/MSVC.

@heading
Requirements
You need to have compiled and installed Allegro version 4.4.2 before building CGUI.
Please note: compiled. Verify that Allegro is correctly build by running the program 
exhello in Allegro's example directory.
There are also other requirements like correctly installed compilers etc. but these are
already fulfilled if you succeded in the above.
<br>
You can find Allegro at:
http://alleg.sourceforge.net/

Installation
Installation goes in the following simple steps, and should be familiar since it is
exactly the same way as you used when installing Allegro:
<ul>
<li>
   Start a konsole (a DOS-box in Windows)
<li>
   Make your cgui directory to the current (e.g. cd ~/cgui or cd c:\cgui etc)
<li>
   Tell the installation process what platform you use. This is done by
   running one of the following at the command line:
<pre>
      To compile with Linux            ./fix.sh unix
      To compile with Cygwin           fix.sh cygwin
      To compile with DOS/DJGPP:       fix.bat djgpp
      To compile with Mac OS X:        ./fix.sh mac
      To compile with Windows/MinGW32: fix.bat mingw32
      To compile with Windows/MSVC:    fix.bat msvc
</pre>
<li>
   For MSVC users only:<br>
   Set up your environment so that MSVC can be used from the commandline.
   You probably have a vcvars32.bat file that will do this for you. (Under
   Windows NT and Windows 2000, you will have to run this file every time
   you open a DOS box, or configure the environment variables in Control
   Panel/System/Environment.)
<li>
   Compile the library. This is done by first running
<pre>make dat2c
</pre>
   at the command line followed by the command
<pre>make
</pre>
<li>
   Install the files to common directories. This is done by running
<pre>
   make install
</pre>
   at the command line. Under Linux and Mac OS X you must be root to do that.
   <br>
   Under Linux, you may want to instead run "make install SYSTEM_DIR=&ltdir&gt",
   which will cause headers to be installed to &ltdir&gt/include and libraries to
   &ltdir&gt/lib. (default for &ltdir&gt is /usr/local)
</ul>
That's it! You may also want to perform some of the optional steps:
<ul><li>
   You can compile a debugging library by typing "make DEBUGMODE=1". To
   compile both the usual and the debug library in one step, type "make all".
<li>
   To use the debugging library with your program, replace cgui with cguid in the
   library specification to the build procedure of your program.
<li>
   If you use Rhide and want to read the CGUI documentation with the Rhide online help
   system, go to the "Help / Syntax help / Files to search" menu, and add
   "cgui" after the existing "libc" entry (separated by a space).
<li>
   If you use the default build there will be built and installed a dynamic
   library. If you want statically linked libraries under Unix or Windows as
   well as the default dynamically linked libraries (dll under Windows, .so
   under Unix), set the environment variable "STATICLINK=1", and repeat the
   "make install" and if you want a debug build "make install DEBUGMODE=1".
   These static libraries require the statically linked version of Allegro.<br>
   If you use the static library your own program using it will contain
   everything, but the executable file will be larger. If you use the
   dynamic library your program will be quite small, but on the other hand
   you also need to append both the dynamic CGUI library and the dynamic
   library of Allegro when you distribute yur program to other people.
</ul>


@heading
MSys
Users of the MSys environment should use the mingw32 port of CGUI and need to
set the environment variable UNIX_TOOLS=1 before make install is run.

@heading
Usage
Read the documentation (e.g. cgui.html) section Usage about how to build
your own program using CGUI.<br>
Run some of the examples and look at the code to get hints how to use CGUI.
Read the documentation to learn more and to see details how it works.
