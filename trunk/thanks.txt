   Shawn Hargreaves (shawn@talula.demon.co.uk).
   Is the author of the original Allegro, which is the base of CGUI.

   The Allegro community. All those people developing this powerful lib.
   CGUI not only is an addon to Allegro it has also directly copied some of
   the datafile sources.

   Sven Sandberg (svsa1977@student.uu.se).
   The author of Adime. The makefiles and the documentation
   structure of Adime has been used directly, for the CGUI package. Sven
   has also came up with useful point of views concerning the design.

   All other that notified me about bugs or came up with good ideas for
   future work.
